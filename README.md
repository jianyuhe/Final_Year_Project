## Projetct Description
This project is about Machine learning, Classification, Deep learning, Convolutional neural networks,
and image processing.
Space checker is a live web application deployed by Django (Django is a high-level Python Web
framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.). this web, VGG16

application has a login page, register page, and home page. the home page can allow the user to
select a different car park to show statues of space. The home page contains a status map
shows the position of free space and space id.
This application is going to design by OpenCV using Python programming language (Python is a
programming language that's soaring in popularity with web and software developers. OpenCV
(Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning
software library.). OpenCV is helpful for image processing.
The database of application is set on PostgreSQL (PostgreSQL is a general-purpose and
object-relational database management system, the most advanced open-source database
system.).
This application is a 3-tier structure, it has presentation tier, application tier, and data tier.
